Daily Coding Problem: Problem #47

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company
in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum
profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once.
You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you
could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

NOTE -
