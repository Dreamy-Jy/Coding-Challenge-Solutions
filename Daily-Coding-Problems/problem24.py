Daily Coding Problem: Problem #24

Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only 
if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.

Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:

    - `is_locked`, which returns whether the node is locked
    
    - `lock`, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot
    be locked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it
    should lock it and return true.
    
    - `unlock`, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked,
    then it should return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it
    and return true.

You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like. You
may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual
locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

NOTE
not fully solved but many of the concepts are correct...
What are locks and mutexes?
